# Exploratory Data Analysis

In this repository, you will find a collection of basic visualizations that I created during an internship years ago. I am currently revisiting and practicing these visualizations through a Udemy course.

Please note that these visualizations are intended to serve as learning material and demonstrate my understanding of simple data visualization concepts. I have implemented the codes included here to gain hands-on experience and improve my skills in data visualization.

Feel free to explore the repository and use the code as a reference or learning resource. If you have any questions or feedback, don't hesitate to reach out. Happy visualizing!
