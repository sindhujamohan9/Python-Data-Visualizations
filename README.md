# Exploratory Data Analysis

In this repository, you will find a collection of basic visualizations that I created during an internship years ago. I am currently revisiting and practicing these visualizations through a Udemy course.

[Here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1QRUZvT-NmmPensImYEWQccZgJ_JMO_B9#scrollTo=gZOiF1v5UK7a) is the Google Colab link for the codes.

If you have any questions or feedback, don't hesitate to reach out. Happy visualizing!
