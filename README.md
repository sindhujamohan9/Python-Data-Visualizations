# Exploratory Data Analysis

In this repository, you will find a collection of basic visualizations that I created during an internship years ago. I am currently revisiting and practicing these visualizations through a Udemy course.

Please note that these visualizations are intended to serve as learning material and demonstrate my understanding of data visualization concepts. They may not represent complex or advanced visualizations but rather focus on fundamental techniques.

The codes included here are derived from an instructor-guided Udemy course. I have implemented them to gain hands-on experience and improve my skills in data visualization.

Feel free to explore the repository and use the code as a reference or learning resource. If you have any questions or feedback, don't hesitate to reach out. Happy visualizing!
