# Exploratory Data Analysis

In this repository, you will find a collection of basic visualizations that I created during an internship years ago. I am currently revisiting and practicing these visualizations through a Udemy course.

If you have any questions or feedback, don't hesitate to reach out. Happy visualizing!
